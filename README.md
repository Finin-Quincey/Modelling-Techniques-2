# ðŸš€ Modelling-Techniques-2

Code for the Modelling Techniques 2 assignment (Year 2 Mechanical Engineering) to simulate a space shuttle thermal protection tile.

The aim of this assignment was to simulate the heat flow through a thermal protection tile during space shuttle re-entry. This code implements forward and backward differencing, DuFort-Frankel and Crank-Nicolson partial differential equation solvers. It also includes a generalised animated graph playback UI for 2D and 3D MATLAB plots and functions to automatically read data from an image of a line graph.

_The MATLAB version used was R2016b_
